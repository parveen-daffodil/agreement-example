# Example Agreement

`Purpose` This agreement shows people how to get a document onto codepact.com (you give a short description of what the agreement does here).

`Party 1 Name` Seller

`Party 2 Name` Buyer

## The first heading (one option)

This is the first clause in the agreement between the Buyer and the Seller.  Two things:

- there's only one clause option (this is the clause); and
- the defined names of the parties (Buyer and Seller) are recognised and hyperlinked automatically.

You can also add a {{text variable}} using these symbols.

## The second heading (two or more options)

If you have clause options in a contract, use three hashes in a row (as you see in the symbols below) to make sure that the system recognises them.

This section, between the heading and the clause options, allows you to explain the options below.  Tell the people who will use template what they should think about when they choose between the two options below.

### This is option 1 under the second heading of the Agreement.

This is the clause text for option 1 under heading 2 of the Agreement.  The word Agreement is highlighted because at the end of this document, it's listed as a defined word.

### This is option 2 under the second heading of the Agreement.

This is the clause text for option 2 under heading 2 of the Agreement between Buyer and Seller.  This is using the Second Definition - and now for a Three Word Definition.

## Definition plurals

There is a Policy and there are also Policies.  The system can recognise the singular and plural version of a defined word.

If you'd like that function for a defined word, you just write the singular and plural the definitions section, separated by a comma.  Take a look in the definitions.

Agreement will be recognised as defined, but Agreements won't be, because the plural isn't provided in the definitions section.

## Definitions

### Agreement
means the legally binding agreement between the Buyer and Seller pursuant to this document.  Definitions can also have {{variables}}.

### Second Definition
means the second definition in the definitions section of the document.  Definitions can refer to other definitions in the Agreement too.

### Policy, Policies
means whatever's relevant to the Agreement.

### Three Word Definition
means you've maxed out the number of words in a defined term.

## Variables

#### text variable

this is the default text for the text variable.

`Guidance` This is the optional guidance that you add to a variable to tell people how to fill it in.  Notice that you put a variable under the clause that it's used in.  You only need to put it a document once, even if you want to use it more than once.  Just use the curly brackets around the same variable name in another clause and it'll show up there too.

You'll also notice that you can use normal markdown formatting (like the bullets above).
